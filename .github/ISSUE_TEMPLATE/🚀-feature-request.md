### ðŸš€ Feature Request: [Feature Title]

#### ðŸ“‹ Description
*A clear and concise description of what the feature is.*

> _Example_: I would like to add a **polling feature** to the web application so users can participate in various polls and view results in real-time.

---

#### ðŸŽ¯ Problem or Motivation
*Explain why this feature is needed and how it would benefit the project.*

> _Example_: Currently, there is no way to gather user feedback within the app. Adding a polling system would increase user engagement and allow for quick, real-time surveys.

---

#### ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution(Optional)
*Describe your proposed solution in detail. Include steps, technologies, and any design aspects.*

> _Example_: I propose adding a new endpoint in the backend to handle poll creation and a front-end component for voting. Using a database to store results and WebSockets for real-time updates.

---

#### ðŸ“š Alternatives Considered
*If there are any alternative solutions or existing features, describe them here.*

> _Example_: We could use third-party polling services like Google Forms, but they would not offer real-time updates or full control over the user experience.

---

#### ðŸ”— Additional Context
*Provide any additional context, screenshots, or links to relevant documentation or existing code.*

> _Example_: Mockup of the polling interface: [Link to image/mockup]
> API documentation for real-time communication: [Link to WebSocket docs]
